Assuming the library is installed, all you have to do to use it is add
 TestCPP to call to target_link_libraries in CMake:
 
 # Assuming you have a separate test executable
 add_executable (
    <your_test_exec_target>
    # ... source files
 )
 
 # Then link the library to your test executable
 target_link_libraries(<your_test_exec_target> TestCPP)

In a Makefile or other custom build system, you simply need to add
 -lTestCPP or equivalent to the linker options.

Please see the project README for how to use it to write and run tests,
 and for other ways to install and use the project.
